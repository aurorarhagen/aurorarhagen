## Hi 😄
I'm Aurora, a student at the Front End Development course at Noroff. I hold a Bachelor's degree in European Studies with Political Science from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. I studied abroad for one semester at the University of California, Berkeley, as part of my Bachelor's degree where I took courses in Sociology. I am currently working on my Front End Development degree and am looking for full-time work or freelance work from the fall of 2025.
